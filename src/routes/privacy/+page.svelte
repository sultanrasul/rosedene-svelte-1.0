            <p class="mt-8 mb-2 font-bold text-white text-[14px]">Use of Cookies</p>
            <p class="mb-5 text-white text-[13px]">
                We use a technology called “cookies” as part of a normal business procedure. Cookies are small text files that are created by a web server and stored on your computer when you visit a website. They don’t do anything i.e. they are not executable code and can only be read by (you and) the website that created them. You can view and edit the cookies on your computer like any other text file using a text editor (the contents are usually just strings of unique identifiers and date / timestamps). The website that created the cookie can read the contents when you are at their website.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-5 text-white text-[13px]">
                Cookies are widely used across the internet: you may have hundreds of cookies on your computer at any one time. Each browser has its own set of cookies so, if you run multiple browsers, you will have multiple sets of cookies on your computer. Many websites use cookies to improve your browsing experience e.g. remember your log-in details, record which items you have selected to purchase, or even tailor what content is displayed depending on your preferences. Cookies can also be used to record ‘analytics’ data i.e. which web pages you visit, whether or not you arrived at the web page by clicking on an advertisement or an affiliated website. Many websites find the collection of analytics data valuable in improving the quality and content of their web sites. We use cookies solely to ensure the smooth running of the website and improve what we can, where we can.            
            </p>

            <p class="mb-5 text-white text-[13px]">
                All the major browsers allow you to block cookies and delete those that have already been created on your computer; usually within the “Tools” section of the browser. These tools allow you to specify which cookies you will accept by type and often by specific websites using an exception list e.g. you can block all cookies and then list the website from which you will accept cookies. There are also a wide choice of browser add-ins that you can install if you wish greater control over persistent cookies.

            <p class="mb-5 text-white text-[13px]">
                We will not transfer your information outside the EEA (European Economic Area) without first obtaining your consent.
